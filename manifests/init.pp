#
# == Class: webserver
#
# This class handles the webserver configuration not tied to any particular
# webserver instance. In practice this means configuring packet filtering rules
# It is usually included by the more specific classes such as 'nginx' or
# 'apache2'.
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*manage*]
#  Whether to manage generic webserver configuration with Puppet or not. Valid 
#  values are true (default) and false.
# [*allow_address_ipv4*]
#   IPv4 addresses/networks from which to allow connections. This parameter can 
#   be either a string or an array. Defaults to 'anyv4' which means that access is 
#   allowed from any IPv4 address.
# [*allow_address_ipv6*]
#   As above but for IPv6 addresses. Defaults to 'anyv6', thus allowing access 
#   from any IPv6 address.
